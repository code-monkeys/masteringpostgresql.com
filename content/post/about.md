Hi! My name is ***Dimitri Fontaine*** and I have been using and contributing
to Open Source Software for the best of the last twenty years. I took role
as developer, maintainer, packager, release manager, software architect,
database architect and administrator, sometimes *devops*. In the same time
frame I also have started several companies (they are still thriving) with a
strong Open Source business model, and I have been in *manager* positions at
times too, including at the Executive level in big companies.
