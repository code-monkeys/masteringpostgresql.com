The most notable project I have contributed to
is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). I wrote
the
[Extension Packaging](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/extend-extensions.html) feature
and
the
[Event Triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/event-triggers.html) facility,
among other contributions.

As
a
[debian](https://www.debian.org) [maintainer](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=dim@tapoueh.org) I
also participated into building a PostgreSQL repository for all currently
supported version of both PostgreSQL and debian, available
at [apt.postgresql.org](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt),
with [Christoph Berg](https://github.com/ChristophBerg)
and [Magnus Hagander](https://blog.hagander.net).

My main project related to PostgreSQL these days
is [pgloader](http://pgloader.io) which allows loading data into PostgreSQL
and include facilities to handle a full database migration from a live
database connection!
