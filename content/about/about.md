Hi! My name is Dimitri. I have been using and contributing to Open Source
Software for the best of the last twenty years. I took role as developer,
maintainer, packager, release manager, software architect, database
architect and administrator, sometimes *devops*. In the same time frame I
also have started several companies (they are still thriving) with a strong
Open Source business model, and I have been in *manager* positions at times
too, including at the Executive level in big companies.

If you've
read
[Charity Major's Engineer/Manager Pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) piece,
there's something to that in my career up to now, definitely. From the
hacker guy to the CEO of a small company, from the PostgreSQL Major
Contributor to the CTO of a big company.
