I am writing a book to share my knowledge about how to best use PostgreSQL
as an application developer. If you've ever asked yourself *how much should
I have my database do for me?* this book is for you. If you're thinking that
using an ORM might not always be the best option out there, if sometimes you
wish SQL was easier to maintain than those concatenated strings with
conditionals, then this book can't wait for you!

*Mastering PostgreSQL in Application Development* is answering practical
questions every developer is confronted to when using PostgreSQL. For
instance, should PostgreSQL be a convenient remote storage facility, or is
there something more to it that comes with those ACID properties?
