## The book isn't what I expected it would be, at all.

**Mastering PostgreSQL in Application Development** is a book that teaches
SQL to application developers. If it's not of any value to you, then just
say so and I'll refund you, no question asked.

## Is there any DRM?

No. There isn't even watermarking on the PDF. You own what you buy.

The sources of data selected for the book are all available with *Open Data*
types of licenses, and the book itself is *© Dimitri Fontaine, all rights
reserved*.

## I selected the “Dead Tree Edition”, can I have the electronic versions too?

Yes of course. The thing is, [Lulu](https://lulu.com) doesn't send the
electronic package automatically. Forward me your *Lulu receipt* and I will
happily send you the electronic package. This includes the PDF, ePub and
MOBI versions of the book.
