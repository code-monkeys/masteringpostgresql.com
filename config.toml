Hi! My name is [Dimitri Fontaine](http://tapoueh.org) and I have been using
and contributing to Open Source Software for the best of the last twenty
years. I am a [PostgreSQL Major
Contributor](https://www.postgresql.org/community/contributors/) and author
of the [pgloader](http://pgloader.io) data loading utility, with fully
automated support for database migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL! Or from
SQLite, or MS SQL, and more.
<br>
<br>
I took role as developer, maintainer, packager, release manager,
software architect, database architect and administrator, sometimes
*devops*. In the same time frame, I also have started several companies
(they are still thriving) with a strong Open Source business model, and I
have been in *manager* positions at times too, including at the Executive
level in big companies.
<br>
<br>
I run a blog at [tapoueh.org](http://tapoueh.org) with in-depth articles
showing advanced use cases for SQL in
my [PostgreSQL is YeSQL](http://tapoueh.org/categories/yesql/) series, check
it out!
