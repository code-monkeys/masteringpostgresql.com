      <description>Hi! My name is Dimitri Fontaine and I have been using and contributing to Open Source Software for the best of the last twenty years. I took role as developer, maintainer, packager, release manager, software architect, database architect and administrator, sometimes devops. In the same time frame, I also have started several companies (they are still thriving) with a strong Open Source business model, and I have been in manager positions at times too, including at the Executive level in big companies.</description>

      <description>I am writing a book to share my knowledge about how to best use PostgreSQL as an application developer. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever asked yourself how much should I have my database do for me? this book is for you. If you&amp;rsquo;re thinking that using an ORM might not always be the best option out there, if sometimes you wish SQL was easier to maintain than those concatenated strings with conditionals, then this book can&amp;rsquo;t wait for you!</description>
