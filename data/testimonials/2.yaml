we have web applications, and his favorite web tooling is found in the PHP
ecosystem. He wrote http://www.pomm-project.org to help integrate PostgreSQL
and PHP better. POMM grants developers with unlimited access to SQL and
database features while proposing a high level API over low level drivers."
